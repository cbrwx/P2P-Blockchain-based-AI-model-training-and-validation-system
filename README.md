# P2P-Blockchain-based-AI-model-training-and-validation-system
This repository contains the source code for a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) blockchain-based AI model training and validation system. 

This is a Python implementation of a peer-to-peer (P2P) network for mining cryptocurrency. The network consists of multiple nodes, each running an instance of the miner script to perform proof-of-useful-work mining and a Masternode script to maintain consensus across the network through validation of blocks.

The consensus algorithm used is a simple hash-based validation of blocks using SHA-256. The mining process involves generating new training data for the AI model based on the current state of the blockchain, performing proof-of-useful-work calculations using the AI model, creating a new block containing the generated data, and broadcasting the new block to the network.

The AI model used in this implementation is fully customizable using the YourAIModel class. This allows for experimentation with various machine learning techniques and architectures to enhance the usefulness of the proof-of-useful-work mining algorithm.

The network is designed to be highly scalable, with nodes able to connect to a large number of peers and exchange data in real-time through the use of a P2P communication protocol.

# Dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch >= 1.7.0
- NumPy
- Pandas

Scripts:

- p2p_network.py:
This script contains the implementation of the P2PNode class that handles the networking aspect of the P2P network. It provides methods to start the node, listen for incoming connections, connect to other nodes, handle incoming messages, add message handlers, and broadcast messages to connected peers.

- miner.py:
This script contains the implementation of the Miner class, which is responsible for mining new blocks and broadcasting them to the network. It takes in a P2PNode instance, a Blockchain instance, and an AI model instance as arguments. It also implements a handle_message method to receive new blocks broadcasted by other nodes.

- masternode.py:
This script contains the implementation of the Masternode class, which handles the maintenance of consensus across the network. It takes in an AI model instance and a port number as arguments. It implements a send_training_data method to broadcast training data to the network, and a process_model_update method to receive updates from nodes and perform updates on the AI model.

- consensus.py:
This script contains the implementation of the Consensus class, which handles the validation of blocks using SHA-256 hashes. It takes in a Blockchain instance as an argument and provides methods to validate blocks and chains.

- blockchain.py:
This script contains the implementation of the Blockchain class, which represents the blockchain. It provides methods to create new blocks, add blocks to the chain, mine blocks, serialize and deserialize the blockchain, and validate the blockchain.

- main.py:
This script is the entry point for running the P2P mining network. It takes in a port number as an argument, initializes the blockchain and consensus algorithm, loads the AI model, initializes and starts the P2P network, initializes and runs the miner in a separate thread.

- model.py:
This script contains the implementation of the SimpleLinearRegression and DynamicTransformer classes that provide simple implementations of linear regression and transformer-based neural networks, respectively. It also provides a CsvDataset class for loading datasets from CSV files.

# Usage:

To start the P2P network, run main.py with a port number as an argument:
```
python main.py [node_port]
```

To start a Masternode, run masternode.py with a port number as an argument:
```
python masternode.py [node_port]
```

An example configuration file for p2p_network.json is as follows:
```
{
    "peers": ["192.168.0.1:5000", "192.168.0.2:5000"],
    "port": 5000
}
```
An example configuration file for masternode.json is as follows:
```
{
    "reward_amount": 100,
    "validation_threshold": 0.95,
    "validation_window": 10
}
`
`reward_amount` specifies the amount of tokens to reward miners for contributing valid blocks, `validation_threshold` specifies the minimum validation score required for a block to be considered valid, and `validation_window` specifies the number of blocks to use for AI model validation.
```

To customize the AI model used for proof-of-useful-work mining, modify and use the YourAIModel class in the miner.py and masternode.py scripts.

To customize the architecture of the dynamic transformer-based AI model, adjust the initial_layers and initial_attention_heads parameters in the DynamicTransformer constructor, and use the adjust_architecture method to add layers or attention heads based on task complexity.

This P2P mining network implementation provides a basic framework for scalable, decentralized cryptocurrency mining using proof-of-useful-work calculations based on machine learning, and in case you are wondering; i absolutely have no life :p - cbrwx.
